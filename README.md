In my professional journey, I've been exploring several areas:
## 1) Model Explainability
Created a fully productionalized tool for Iberia (main spanish airlines company). The tool was splited into two Sagemaker pipelines you can find under the name of AI Explainatory Drivers.

- [AI Explainatory Drivers: VS Past Pipeline](https://github.com/nomadicsenseis/AI_Explanatory_Drivers-VS_past_pipeline)
- [AI Explainatory Drivers: VS Target Pipeline](https://github.com/nomadicsenseis/AI_Explanatory_Drivers-VS_target_pipeline)

## 2) Time Series
Time Series Forecasting as a regression problem through machine/deep learning methods. 

- [Production Notebooks based on Darts](https://github.com/nomadicsenseis/Forecasting-with-Darts-Hyperparameter-tunning-with-Optuna-andand-Explainability-with-SHAP)

## 3) Large Language Models (LLMs)
I'm currently working with HuggingFace's pretrained models, focusing on fine-tuning and managing multi-agent systems with tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex. Iâ€™ve also ventured into creating transformer architectures, including a full Encoder-Decoder model and a Vision Transformer (ViT), though their training remains a future goal due to cost constraints.

- [Annoted Encoder-Decoder](https://github.com/nomadicsenseis/annoted-transformer)
- [Matching Engine based on BERT and BM25](https://github.com/nomadicsenseis/Matching_Engine)
- [Vision Transformer](https://github.com/nomadicsenseis/VisionTransformer)
- [Vision Transformer Transfer Learning](https://github.com/nomadicsenseis/ViT_transfer_learning)

## 4) MLOps
Asides from the productionalized AI Explanatory Drivers tools done with Sagemaker pipelines, I have also done side projects involving other popular MLOps frameworks:
- Airflow [Local airflow pipeline](https://github.com/nomadicsenseis/airflow_binary_classifier)
- Kubeflow/Vertex AI Pipelines [Real time forecasting in the GCP](https://github.com/nomadicsenseis/Real-time-forecasting-with-BQML-and-VertexAI-pipelines)
- RestAPI with Flask and Gunicorn [Pretrained ViT deployment](https://github.com/nomadicsenseis/stage_0_REST_API_DOCKER)
- RestAPI to run on Kubernets [Pretrained ViT deployment on K8s](https://github.com/nomadicsenseis/VIT_image_classifier_stage_1)
