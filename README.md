# Professional Overview

**Physicist. Mathematician.**  
*A genuine passion for learning.*  
*I find pleasure in philosophizing while doing outdoor sports.*

In my professional journey, I've been exploring several areas:
## 1) Model Explainability
Created a fully productionalized tool for Iberia (main spanish airlines company). THe tool was splited in two Sagemaker pipelines you can find under the name of AI Explainatory Drivers.

## 2) Large Language Models (LLMs)
I'm currently working with HuggingFace's pretrained models, focusing on fine-tuning and managing multi-agent systems with tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex. I’ve also ventured into creating transformer architectures, including a full Encoder-Decoder model and a Vision Transformer (ViT), though their training remains a future goal due to cost constraints.

## 3) MLOps
My experience ranges from initial development in notebooks to full-scale production. I use tools like:
- Airflow
- SageMaker Pipelines
- Kubeflow
- Vertex AI Pipelines

I've built systems using Spark and various cloud services for distributed training. I'm also learning to create user-friendly interfaces with Streamlit and Gradio. Containerization with Docker and deployment using Kubernetes or cloud services are areas where I'm growing my skills.

## 4) Time Series
I'm delving into Time Series Forecasting, treating it as a regression problem through machine/deep learning methods. I’m familiar with using Darts, integrating it with Optuna for optimization, and exploring SHAP for added clarity.
